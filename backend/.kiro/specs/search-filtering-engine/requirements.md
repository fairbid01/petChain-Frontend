# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing search module in the PetChain NestJS backend with a powerful, production-grade search and filtering engine. The system currently uses PostgreSQL ILIKE queries and has a basic Elasticsearch client configured. This feature will extend the existing `SearchModule` to support full-text search via PostgreSQL tsvector/tsquery (with optional Elasticsearch integration), advanced multi-field filtering, relevance-based ranking, geospatial veterinarian search, and search analytics tracking across three primary entities: Pets, Veterinarians, and Medical Records.

## Glossary

- **Search_Engine**: The NestJS `SearchModule` responsible for executing search queries across all entities.
- **Pet**: A registered animal in the system, stored in the `pets` table with fields such as name, species, breed, color, and microchip number.
- **Vet**: A veterinarian record in the `vets` table with fields such as clinic name, specializations, city, state, and license number.
- **Medical_Record**: A clinical record in the `medical_records` table linked to a Pet and optionally a Vet, containing diagnosis, treatment, record type, and notes.
- **Full_Text_Search**: Search using PostgreSQL `tsvector`/`tsquery` or Elasticsearch to match terms across multiple fields with ranking.
- **Relevance_Score**: A numeric score assigned to each search result indicating how closely it matches the query, used for ordering results.
- **Facet**: An aggregated count of distinct values for a filterable field (e.g., breed counts, specialty counts) returned alongside search results.
- **Geospatial_Search**: A search that filters Vets by proximity to a given latitude/longitude coordinate within a specified radius.
- **Search_Analytics**: Persisted records of each search query including type, filters applied, result count, response time, and success status.
- **Autocomplete**: A suggestion mechanism that returns partial-match terms from indexed fields as the user types.
- **Index**: A PostgreSQL GIN index on a `tsvector` column, or an Elasticsearch index, used to accelerate full-text search.
- **SearchQueryDto**: The NestJS DTO that carries all search parameters including query string, filters, pagination, and sort options.
- **SearchAnalytics_Entity**: The TypeORM entity `search_analytics` that persists each search event for analytics purposes.
